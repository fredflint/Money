TASK LIST

task: moved equals() method to base class Money; see how operator overloads work. maybe ok now, but fail in the futrue?
* add a teste thse operators work ok?

testing equals() and  verify that object type dollar != franc
* using typeid in base class, takes class& ref type; but derived classes are returning base class name, not derived class name
* changed to add runttime type info in compiler (for exe, not for lib) - still gets base class type  ("money")
* changed to add runttime type info in compiler (for exe, and for lib) - still gets base class type  ("money")
* add virtual method getClass() and dont use it - but now the equals() method gets proper derived class types "dollar" "franc"

--  The expression must point to a polymorphic type (a class with virtual functions). Otherwise, the result is the type_info for the static class referred to in the expression.
* remove and make the equals() method virtual; do not override in derived classes; test works now

* change to use pointers with c++ factory method?
* use smart pointesr with c++ pointer objects

USING heap allocated objects, pointers; using std smartpointer; verify that NOT using smartpointer leads to memory leak
